### Description

Did you ever hear that "A picture is worth a thousand words"? Well, my program take it literally. It can add to a picture a thousand words and more depending on the picture size. Just think of this: in a bitmap of 800x600 pixels can be hidden up to 160,000(160 thousand!) characters. And the text will be encrypted in the strongest way you have ever seen. I also included a quiz, in case you don't believe me about the encryption strength. Note: You must have the color depth set to 32 bits.
